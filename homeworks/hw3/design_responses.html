							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned just how important the typography can be when creating a website. I never put as much weight or attention into its importance, but also how it changes based on the type of information you are trying to get across or the message that you want to convey. I also thought it was interesting that typography can be changed based on the audience you want to attract. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I found it really interesting how a certain font can be used to convey a certain feeling or vibe in order to allure a certain target audience. While fonts and typography is often ignored, it plays a very significant role. I just find it interesting how something so small can be so integral to the success of a site. </p>
