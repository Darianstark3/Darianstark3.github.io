						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned a lot from the article. I never put so much thought into animations before and I found it really interesting how every small aspect impacts usability. Notably, I can now see that having an animation be a little too long makes it annoying for users who want to move quickly or for repeated use when the user doesnt want to have to wait. I think it just showcases how important every tiny aspect is in web development. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I loved how the article included samples of animations throughout the article. By doing this, it highlights exactly the difference between "good" and bad animations and transitions. Furthermore, this allows us to go "oh yeah, that one does look a lot better" when we probably wouldnt think about it too much otherwise. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "Numerous researches have discovered that optimal speed for interface animation is between 200 and 500 ms" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
