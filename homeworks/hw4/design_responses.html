						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> Besides having not put a great deal of thought into color accessibility in the designs and products we use, I did not know of the legal implications. I always thought that if a website or something were to be bad for people with forms of color blindness, that at most, the site would not perform well with that demographic. The fact that these laws/regulations are in place is actually kind of cool with how inclusive it is, given that it is rare for their to be laws for inclusion. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I liked the part of the article that talked about different ways to incorporate accessibility without sacrificing color design. For example, having a website without color would look awful but incorporating symbols or patterns in order to distinguish between things that are also separated by color helps include individuals. I really enjoyed the examples as they help guide and give inspiration on how to solve this issues without compromising on colorful designs. </p>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>

						</li>
