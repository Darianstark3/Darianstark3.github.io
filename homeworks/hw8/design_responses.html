				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I already knew about deceptive design online. That being said, I did not know about the far-reaching impacts of dark patterns in UI such as large financial ramifications of deceptive design. I also did not know the term for this form of design honestly. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> Oddly enough, I enjoyed learning about the history of dark patterns in UI. While I had heard of it before, vaguely, I just found the rise and destruction of its use rather interesting. Which is funny because I normally dislike learning history. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> "a dark pattern is a misleading or otherwise deceptive UI/UX decision that tries to exploit human psychology to get users to do things they donâ€™t really want to do." </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
