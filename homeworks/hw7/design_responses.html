						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>While I knew or assumed that web design took advantage of certain human behaviors and psychology, I did not know that we took advantage of evolutionary characteristics. That is to say that I knew about color theory and association, but its interesting how we can make more compelling designs by exploiting how our brains have evolved to see different shapes. Furthermore, I find it incredibly interesting how we use these survival-based associations to show relationships between elements. </p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I love the examples that the article provides. Design can be confusing on paper and I think it needs clear examples. So by comparing good vs bad design throughout the article, I am able to understand what it is trying to teach me.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "“Great designers understand the powerful role that psychology plays in visual perception. What happens when someone’s eye meets your design creations?" </p>
						</li>
					</ul>
